ABSTRACT = {The elementary cellular automata (ECAs) under the chaotic rule possess long periodicity and are widely used in pseudo-random number generators. However, their period is limited, related to the rule and the number of cells. Meanwhile, the Boolean functions of some ECAs are linear and vulnerable to linear analysis. Thus, the ECA cannot be directly implemented in the stream cipher. In this paper, a hybrid ECA (HECA) with dynamic mask (HECA-M) is designed. The HECA-M consists of two parts: the driving and mask parts. The driving part based on a HECA is used in generating the keystream, and the mask part based on a chaotic ECA is utilized to determine the iterative rule of the driving part. Subsequently, a stream cipher based on the HECA-M and SHA-512 is proposed. The statistic and secure analyses indicate that the proposed stream cipher possesses good randomness and can resist stream cipher analyses, such as exhaustive search, Berlekamp–Massey synthesis, guess and determine attack, time–memory–data tradeoff attack, etc. Hence, the proposed scheme can meet security requirements. Moreover, the time and space consumption of the proposed stream cipher is qualified.},
